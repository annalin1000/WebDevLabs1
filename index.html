            <h2>Hi, my name is Anna Lin</h2>
            <img src="static/HEADSHOT.png" width="348" height="463">
            <p>I am a freshman majoring in Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University. I enjoy exploring the intersections of technology, healthcare, and the arts. <br><br>
                In high school, I was deeply invovled in STEM outreach, hosting coding workshops for underserved communities to help girls explore their passions in 
                technology. At the same time, I fostered artistic expression by choreographing dance pieces open to all student, creating a space for creative exploration. 
                I also developed a storng interest in research and problem-solbing, which led me to pursue interdisciplinary projects.
                <br><br>
                During the summer before college, I interned at Boeing, working on 
                industrial engineering and additive manufacturing projects. I co-led an Integrated Project Team, hosted weekly conferences for 65 interns, and facilitated discussions with guest speakers to help students navigate careers in STEM. Now, in college, I continue applying my technical and analytical skills to research, including AI bias studies and exploratory data analysis, as I work toward a future in medicine. </p>
